# Smart Community Health Monitoring and Early Warning System for Water-Borne Diseases  

## 📌 Project Overview  
Access to clean drinking water remains a major challenge in rural areas of Northeast India. Contaminated water sources are a primary cause of **water-borne diseases** such as diarrhea, cholera, and typhoid.  

This project proposes a **Smart Community Health Monitoring System** that combines **IoT-based water purity sensors, mobile app data collection, cloud backend processing, and early warning alerts** to monitor and improve water safety in rural communities.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Detect and monitor **real-time water purity levels** (pH, turbidity, TDS, temperature).  
- Collect and analyze water quality data via **IoT sensors and mobile apps**.  
- Provide **alerts and early warnings** for potential water-borne disease risks.  
- Empower rural communities with **accessible and actionable insights**.  
- Assist **local authorities and NGOs** in planning preventive health measures.

## 🏗️ System Architecture  

### 1. IoT Water Purity Sensor Module  
- Measures water parameters: pH, turbidity, TDS, and temperature.  
- Sends data via **Wi-Fi/Bluetooth** to mobile or gateway.  

### 2. Mobile App / Manual Data Entry  
- Collects sensor readings or allows manual water test data entry.  
- Displays **real-time water quality status**.  
- Provides **community reporting features**.  

### 3. Backend Processing & Data Storage  
- Stores readings in **cloud database**.  
- Uses **AI/ML models** to detect contamination trends.  
- Generates **water safety index & risk level**.  

### 4. Early Warning & Health Advisory System  
- Sends **SMS/Push notifications** for unsafe water levels.  
- Suggests **preventive health measures**.  
- Provides data to **local health authorities** for outbreak prevention.
